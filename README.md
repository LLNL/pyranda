# pyranda
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/LLNL/pyranda.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LLNL/pyranda)

A Python driven, Fortran powered Finite Difference solver for arbitrary hyperbolic PDE systems.  This is the mini-app for the Miranda code.

The PDE solver defaults to a 10th order compact finite difference method for spatial derivatives, and a 5-stage, 4th order Runge-Kutta scheme for temporal integration.  Other numerical methods will be added in the future.
  
Pyranda parses (through a simple interpreter) the full definition of a system of PDEs, namely:
  - a domain and discretization (in 1D, 2D or 3D)
  - governing equations written on RHS of time derivatives.
  - initial values for all variables
  - boundary conditions



## Prerequisites
At a minimum, your system will need the following installed to run pyranda. (see install notes for detailed instructions) 
- A fortran compiler with MPI support
- python 2.7, including these packages
  - numpy
  - mpi4py

## Tutorials
A few tutorials are included on the [project wiki page](https://github.com/LLNL/pyranda/wiki) that cover the example below, as well as few others.  A great place to start if you want to discover what types of problems you can solve.


## Example Usage - Solve the 1D advection equation in less than 10 lines of code
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/LLNL/pyranda/blob/master/examples/tutorials/notebooks/advection.ipynb)

The one-dimensional advection equation is written as:

![Advection](http://mathurl.com/y7qnvzeg.png)

where phi is a scalar and where c is the advection velocity, assumed to be unity.  We solve this equation 
in 1D, in the x-direction from (0,1) using 100 points and evolve the solution .1 units in time.

### 1 - Import pyranda
`from pyranda import pyrandaSim`

### 2 - Initialize a simulation object on a domain/mesh
`pysim = pyrandaSim('advection',"xdom = (0.0 , 1.0 , 100 )")`

### 3 - Define the equations of motion
`pysim.EOM(" ddt(:phi:)  =  - ddx(:phi:) ")`

### 4 - Initialize variables
`pysim.setIC(":phi: = 1.0 + 0.1 * exp( -(abs(meshx-.5)/.1 )**2 )")`

### 5 - Integrate in time
`dt = .001`  
`time = 0.0`  
`while time < .1:`    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`time = pysim.rk4(time,dt)`  

### 6 - Plot the solution
`pysim.plot.plot('phi')`
