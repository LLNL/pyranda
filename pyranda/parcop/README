To reproduce error:


*On rzansel, 1 node (lalloc 1 -W 60)


1) make miniAppGPU
2) lrun -n 1 miniAppGPU 500 128 1 128 1 128 1



Expected error:
Current map  [0x7fffffff7e90, 0x7fffffff7ef7] len=104 :
    Src: miniApp.f90 Line: 294 Column: 48 Listitem: tmp(pointer)
Previous map [0x7fffffff7e30, 0x7fffffff7e97] len=104 :
    <No description available>
1587-168 Encountered a map that partially includes the memory of a prior map on the target device 0. The encountered map starts at host address 0x7fffffff7e90 and the prior map starts at host address 0x7fffffff7e30.  The program will stop.

Error goes away if the 'EOS' subroutine is manually inlined.  See miniApp.EOS.inlined.f90 for example of inlined EOS subroutine.

This type of mapping error can be generated by moving around either EOS or divFoo subroutines in the calling code.  Behavior appears to be problematic with the dependency tracking on the nowait/depends,
when returning from a subroutine call.
